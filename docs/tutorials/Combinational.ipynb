    "# Combinational Logic in Minispec\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinational circuits, also known as Boolean circuits, are a basic building block of digital logic. A combinational circuit has digital inputs and outputs; each output is a Boolean function of its current inputs (i.e., the circuit has no memory or state); and each output is  guaranteed to reach a stable digital value after a bounded *propagation delay* from the time at which the inputs reach valid digital values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture, we have seen how to describe the behavior of combinational circuits using Boolean formulas or truth tables, and how to implement these circuits using gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to design combinational circuits in Minispec. We will cover the following topics:\n",
    "1. The Bool type and Boolean operations\n",
    "2. Functions\n",
    "3. Manual synthesis of functions into combinational circuits\n",
    "4. The Bit#(n) type and Bit operations\n",
    "5. Types and type inference\n",
    "6. Conditional expressions\n",
    "7. Automatic synthesis of functions into combinational circuits\n",
    "8. Parametric functions and Integers\n",
    "9. User-defined types\n",
    "10. Higher-level constructs: if, case, and for statements\n",
    "11. Advanced features: ?, assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "These topics build on each other and present increasingly advanced language features. In particular, topics 1 and 2 suffice to build any combinational circuit; every other feature is a convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses interactive examples. You can execute each code snippet (cell) by pressing *Shift+Enter*. The executable examples consist of Boolean functions and one of two special commands, called *magics*: `%%eval` to evaluate a function and `%%synth` to synthesize it into a circuit. (These magics are not part of the Minispec language, but separate commands integrated in Jupyter; see Section 13 of the Minispec reference for more details)."

    "## 3. Manual synthesis of functions into combinational circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "Minispec functions can *always* be synthesized to combinational circuits. This is because functions have two key properties:\n",
    "1. *Pure*: Functions compute the output based only on the values of its input arguments. They cannot use or alter any state or variables outside the function.\n",
    "2. *Acyclic*: Functions have no cycles, i.e., they cannot \"jump back\" to a prior point of execution. They are thus always guaranteed to terminate in a bounded number of steps, and that number is independent of the particular values of the input arguments. This is why recursion is not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, Minispec functions are synthesized by composing smaller building blocks. This\n",
    "exploits that combinational circuits compose easily: a circuit composed of multiple combinational devices connected with wires\n",
    "is also combinational if each input of the constituent devices is tied to a single output or a constant value, and if the network is acyclic, i.e., it has no directed cycles (which may create feedback loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Minispec functions are acyclic, one can synthesize a function by synthesizing a\n",
    "each syntax element (expression, statement, etc.) and connecting them. \n",
    "Though the details of synthesis depend on the compiler and tools used, it is useful to roughly understand how syntax elements are translated and composed. With what we have seen so far, we need only three rules:\n",
    "1. Each complex expression is broken down into a tree of basic operations (e.g., operators or function calls), then each operation is synthesized, and finally their inputs and outputs are wired together in the same tree fashion.\n",
    "2. All operators (e.g., ``&&``, ``||``, etc.) can be implemented using combinational circuits. Each operator is synthesized as a separate circuit.\n",
    "3. Functions are **inlined**: each function call instantiates a separate circuit implementing the function, which is then synthesized (since there’s no recursion, inlining functions always terminates).\n",
    "\n",
    "The last rule is particularly important to keep in mind, because it is completely different from how software procedures are commonly implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these rules, we can manually synthesize all the functions we have seen so far. For example, the figure below shows the manual synthesis of the ``and2`` and ``and4`` circuits.\n",

    "## 4. The Bit#(n) type and operations\n",
    "\n",
    "While `Bool` is technically the only type we need to write combinational circuits, working with many single-bit values gets tedious quickly. For example, if we wanted to code a function that operated on a 32-bit number, we'd need to pass 32 `Bool` arguments! Even worse, since each function can produce only one output result, implementing circuits with several output wires would require a separate function per output wire.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, Minispec provides more complex types that encapsulate a collection of bits. The most basic of these is `Bit#(n)`, which encodes an ``n``-bit value (``n`` must be a non-negative number). Most types (all except `Integer`, which we will see later) are represented in hardware using a fixed number of bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first order of business is how to assign fixed values (e.g., 0, 1, 42, etc.) to `Bit#(n)` variables. This is the role of number literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number literals:** \n",
    "Number literals encode numeric values. They can be **sized** or **unsized**. Sized literals\n",
    "encode their bit-width, i.e., the number of bits they take. By contrast, unsized literals\n",
    "have no explicit bit-width. Literals can be specified in decimal, hexadecimal, and\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Bit-width, written as a decimal number.\n",
    "2. Base: ’d for decimal, ’h for hexadecimal, and ’b for binary.\n",
    "3. Value, written using digits in the specified base (0–9 for decimal, 0–9 and a–f for hex, and 0 or 1 for binary).\n",

    "An unsized number literal has no bit-width, and consists of an optional base and\n",
    "value. If the base is not given, the value is interpreted as decimal.\n",

    "Minispec is a *strongly typed language* with *static type checking*: every variable and expression has a type, and that type must be known statically, i.e., at compile time. Variables must be assigned values with compatible types.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen two types, `Bool` and `Bit#(n)`, and have informally seen strong typing and static type checking at work. For instance, so far we have specified the type of every variable (e.g., `Bool x = True;`), and seen how every variable has a fixed type: whereas in languages like Python one can write `x = True` and later `x = 2`, in Minispec you cannot have the same variable take `Bool` and `Bit#(n)` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minispec has other built-in types and the ability to define your own types. We will introduce these concepts later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type conversions are explicit:**\n",
    "Unlike in some languages, in Minispec almost all conversions between values of different types are explicit. For example, it is illegal to assign a `Bool` value to a `Bit#(1)` variable (or vice versa), even though both take one bit to represent. Similarly, it is illegal to assign `Bit#(4)` value to a `Bit#(8)` variable, because they have a different number of bits and *implicit bit-width extensions never happen*. This makes code more verbose but reduces mistakes, as shown below:\n",
    "```minispec\n",
    "Bool b = True;\n",
    "Bit#(1) x = b;         // Error, cannot convert from Bool to Bit#(1)\n",

    "Bit#(8) k = {0, i};    // OK, uses concatenation to zero-extend i\n",
    "```\n",
    "The one exception to this rule is the `Integer` type, which we will see in Section 8.\n",
    "`Integer` values work just like unsized literals and can be assigned to `Bit#(n)` variables without explicit conversion. For example:\n",
    "```minispec\n",
    "Integer n = 3 * 4; // n=12\n",
    "Bit#(8) x = n;     // OK\n",
    "Bit#(n) y = n * n; // OK, Bit#(12) y = 144;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type inference:**  Minispec allows omitting a variable’s type by using the `let`\n",
    "keyword. The compiler will infer the variable’s type from the expression assigned to the\n",
    "variable. For example:\n",
    "```minispec\n",
    "Bit#(4) x = 1;\n",
    "let y = x;       // Bit#(4)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "* `truncate` truncates the most-significant bits of its argument to match the bit-width of a narrower destination.\n",
    "* `zeroExtend` adds zeros to the left of the argument to match the bit-width of a wider destination.\n",
    "* `signExtend` extends the argument by replicating its most significant bit to match the bit-width of a wider destination.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```minispec\n",
    "Bit#(4) a = 4’b1001;\n",
    "Bit#(2) x = truncate(a);    // 2’b01\n",
    "Bit#(6) y = zeroExtend(a);  // 6’b001001\n",
    "Bit#(6) z = signExtend(a);  // 6’b111001\n",
    "Bit#(6) w = signExtend(x);  // 6’b000001\n",
    "```\n",

In other words, the code will call **either** ``foo(x)`` or ``bar(y)``, but not both. This avoids wasted work because only one result is needed, and ``foo`` and ``bar`` may be long functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **not at all** how conditional expressions are synthesized in Minispec, because combinational logic does not allow for conditional execution. Remember: functions describe combinational circuits, functions are inlined when called, and conditional expressions translate to muxes. Thus, synthesizing ```r = foo(x) if c else bar(y)``` will (1) synthesize ``foo(x)``, i.e., creating an instance of the circuit implementing function ``foo`` with input ``x``; (2) synthesize ``bar(y)``, and (3) use a 2-to-1 mux to select between the outputs of ``foo(x)`` and ``bar(y)``. Note how the circuit will evaluate **both** ``foo(x)`` and ``bar(y)``.\n",
